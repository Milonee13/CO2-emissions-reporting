# CO2-emissions-reporting
## Overview
This project focuses on transportation-related CO2 emissions reporting with an emphasis on supporting ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) goals. By integrating multiple datasets and performing detailed calculations, the project lays a foundation for evaluating the environmental impact of transportation operations and improving sustainability metrics.

## Key Processes
### Data Integration:

- Imported datasets for shipment details, unit conversions (to kilograms), route distances, and city GPS locations.
- Merged and joined datasets to create a comprehensive record for emissions calculations.
  
### CO2 Emission Analysis:

- Calculated emissions based on weight (in kg), distance traveled, and emission ratios.

### Aggregated data at multiple levels:

- Order Line Level: Granular insights into specific shipments.
- Order Level: High-level summaries for ESG reporting.

### Data Visualization:

Created visual insights, such as mapping high-emission routes, to highlight areas for improvement.

## ESG Reporting Contributions
This project directly supports ESG reporting by:

### Environmental Metrics:

- Quantifying CO2 emissions from transportation activities.
- Identifying high-impact routes and areas for emission reductions.
- Offering actionable insights to optimize logistics and reduce carbon footprints.

### Governance and Compliance:

- Ensuring data-driven approaches align with sustainability goals.
- Supporting transparent reporting to meet regulatory and stakeholder demands.
  
### Social Responsibility:

Contributing to a more sustainable supply chain ecosystem.
Supporting broader climate goals by reducing emissions.

## Findings and Outcomes
### High-Emission Routes Identified:
- Routes with significant CO2 emissions were pinpointed for optimization.
  
### Potential for Emission Reductions:
- Optimizing transportation weight distribution and route planning can lead to measurable sustainability improvements.
  
### Framework for ESG Alignment:

This project provides a robust methodology for calculating and reporting transportation emissions, aligning operations with ESG criteria.
